Lab Overview

This lab consists of two parts. In the first p art of the lab, you‚Äôre tasked with profiling and analysing the runtime behaviour of few provided applications using Intel VTune Profiler .

In the second part of the lab, you‚Äôre tasked w ith running the same applications on a simulator, known as ChampSim , to understand the performance impact caused by different configurations of caches in a system.

NOTE:

1. You‚Äôll need to do the second part of the l ab inside a Docker container, that has everything set up. Although this is not m andatory and you can decide to not do it inside the container, setting up the environment a nd everything else will be up to you however

2. Some tips for this lab are provided in the final section of this document

3. The submission format is in the second-last s ection of this document

A report that summarizes the results of your analyses a nd the simulations will need to be submitted. The template for the report is provided in the ZIP file for the assignment.

Part 0: Getting Things Ready (10 points)

(6 points)

Install Intel VTune Profiler by following the instructions from this link

(You have to figure out on your own how to install i t and get it up and running. Feel free to discuss among yourselves)

(2 points)

How easy was it for you to install Vtune and get it up and running ? What were the challenges that you faced during the installation process a nd how much time did it take in total?

(2 points)

Install Docker for your operating system, in case you haven‚Äôt already installed it.

‚Äì Windows Installation Guide

‚Äì Linux Installation Guide

‚Äì MacOS installation Guide

Pull the following Docker image for the second part of the lab:

0xd3ba/champsim-lab

Part 1: Profiling with VTune (30 points)

The src/ directory in the provided ZIP file has 4 p rograms

‚Äì bfs.cpp

‚Äì matrix_multi.cpp

‚Äì matrix_multi_2.cpp

‚Äì quicksort.cpp

‚óè Compile each of the files with the following c ompiler flags:

‚óã -g (Enable debugging)

‚óã -O2 (Enable high compiler optimization)

‚óè Try running the programs for a test run. If it takes less than 1-2 seconds, open t he files and configure the programs (described in the comments at the top) so that it takes at least 3-10 seconds to finish running. The parameters will be different for different system configurations.

(6+24 points)

Open VTunes and create a new project for each program. Run the following analyses and answer the following questions for each program.

Performance Snapshot (2+2+2 points)

1. What is the IPC that you have observed ?

2. What logical core utilization and physical core utilization have you observed ?

3. What % of the pipeline slots are memory bound ?

Hotspots (4+20 points)

1. List down the top hotspots that were identified along with their CPU time.

2. Identify and list down the statements in the program‚Äôs source code (ignore the ones that are from source code of the libraries) that were responsible for consuming most of the CPU time (in descending order of the % of C PU time consumed. Make sure to note down the % as well)

Summarize all the results that you have obtained, a long with screenshots of the results in the report.

Part 2: Simulating with ChampSim (60 points)

Pull the Docker image ( 0xd3ba/champsim-lab ) and run a container from it. Alternatively, if you don‚Äôt want to use Docker , fork the Champsim repository and get appropriate version of Intel‚Äôs PIN tool (watch out for nasty issues later on ;))

champsim/

|‚Äì Champsim/ # Forked Champsim repository

|‚Äì pin_v3.17/ # Intel‚Äôs PIN Tool

|‚Äì programs/ # Source code for the programs |‚Äì traces/ # Traces MUST be placed here

(Structure of the champsim directory inside t he container)

(6 points)

Prepare the traces for each program by following the instructions in the Champsim repository (using the same configuration that led to 3-10 second execution time previously. Y ou might want to edit the source files again, if you‚Äôre doing t he lab inside the container) Move them to the /champsim/traces/ directory inside the container.

(6 points)

Build Champsim and run the simulation on each of the traces you prepared previously. These will be the baseline results.

Make sure to store them separately in a directory named as baseline/ , as they will be required later on. The following are the configurations f or building and running the simulations

For building,

Parameter Value

Branch Predictor bimodal

L1I Prefetcher no

L1D Prefetcher no

L2C Prefetcher no

LLC Prefetcher no

Replacement Policy lru

# of CPU cores 1

For running,

Parameter Value

# of warm-up instructions 10

# of simulation instructions 10

You‚Äôll get outputs in results_10M/ directory as .txt files for each trace.

IMPORTANT: Before starting to attempt the following q uestions, make sure you note down the default values of whatever you‚Äôll be changing later on.

(8 points) Effect of using Direct-Mapped Cache at all levels

Explore your way out through the source c ode and change all the caches to Direct-Mapped caches while ensuring that the cache sizes remain constant. Build Champsim again and run the simulations using each o f the traces, similar to the previous section.

Comment out your observations after comparing with the results obtained from the baseline configuration (of the appropriate trace). Did t he IPC improve ? What about MPKI ? What about the average miss latency ? Why do you think it h appened ?

Store the results separately in a separate d irectory named as direct-mapped/

(8 points) Effect of using Fully-Associative Cache at all levels

Reset the changed parameters to their original v alues and change all the caches to Fully-Associative caches while ensuring that the cache sizes remain constant.

Build Champsim again and run the simulations using each o f the traces, similar to the previous section.

Comment out your observations after comparing with the results obtained from the baseline configuration (of the appropriate trace). Did t he IPC improve ? What about MPKI ? What about the average miss latency ? Why do you think it h appened ?

Store the results separately in a separate d irectory named as fully-associative/

(8 points) Effect of halving the size of the caches at all levels

Reset the changed parameters to their original v alues and decrease the number of sets in all the caches by half. Make sure to change the latency (in cycles) appropriately (and mention the values in the report)

(8 points) Effect of doubling the size of the caches at all levels

Reset the changed parameters to their original v alues and double the number of sets in all the caches. Make sure t o change the latency (in cycles) appropriately (and mention the values in the report)

Tips for the Lab (in case you get stuck) üôÇ

‚óè Don‚Äôt know how to prepare the traces ? You m ight want to check out the ‚ÄúHow to create Traces‚Äù section in the ChampSim‚Äôs repository.

‚óã No need to change the PIN tool‚Äôs location. I t has been already set for you

‚óã You will need to compress whatever PIN o utputs using xz utility. This is important or else ChampSim will complain. Worst case scenarios ‚Äì will segfault or will be stuck in an infinite loop without telling you (thank you ChampSim) .

‚óã One of the things that is required to prepare the trace with PIN tool will be located inside obj-intel64/ sub-directory inside Champsim as a *.so file (Don‚Äôt bother searching for it as it only gets created when you execute the appropriate steps üòâ )

‚óè What should be the number of instructions to t race with pin tool ? Set it to sum of the number of warmup and simulation instructions.

‚óè Champsim‚Äôs run_champsim.sh script takes the number of instructions in units of millions. So if you are asked to simulate for 20 million instructions, give it a value of 20 and it will interpret it as 20 million.

Don‚Äôt make the mistake of giving it a v alue of 20,000,000 instead!

‚óè If Champsim takes too long to finish simulation (15+ minutes for 10M simulation instructions), interrupt the execution and check the (partially written) .txt file in results_10M/ directory to ensure everything‚Äôs alright.

‚óè How to convert the set-associative cache to direct-mapped / fully-associative ? T ry to think ‚Äì What are the number of ‚Äúsets‚Äù and ‚Äúnumber of lines per set‚Äù in a direct-mapped cache ? What are they for fully-associative ?

‚óè When you increase the size of the cache, does the hit time (lookup latency) increase or decrease ?

‚óè Where to find IPC and other information ? Check t he .txt file for the corresponding trace, after the simulation has been completed. You‚Äôll find the statistics there.

‚óè ‚ÄúI forgot to note down the default values a nd I don‚Äôt know what to set now ‚Äù ‚Äì Fear not, just delete the container and create a new c ontainer from the docker image. Everything will be reset to defaults (although you‚Äôll have to prepare the traces again).
